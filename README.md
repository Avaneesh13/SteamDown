## What is SteamDown?

SteamDown is a utility that monitors Steam download activity. If there is no download activity for a user-defined amount of time, SteamDown will automatically perform your chosen action‚Äîsuch as stopping Steam, shutting down your PC, putting your PC to sleep, and more. This helps automate your system's behavior after downloads finish, saving power and time.

- Automatically performs actions after downloads finish (shutdown, sleep, stop Steam, and more)
- User-configurable inactivity timer and action selection
- Modern, intuitive GUI
- Easy-to-use standalone executable

**Upcoming:**
- Light & system theme mode
- Bugfixes & performance improvements
- Support for other game launchers (ideas welcome!)

### For Developers
- Modular, well-organized codebase
- 100% Python (3.7.9+)
